# YOLO in caffe

## Introduction

This is a caffe implementation of the YOLO:Real-Time Object Detection

Note, the caffe models are not trained in caffe, but converted from darknet's (.weight) files (http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).

The converter is consisted of three steps:

* initialize the caffe network and weights from .prototxt file, which is generated from darknet's (.cfg) file
* read the weights from pre-trained darknet's (.weight) file
* replace the initialized weights with the weights in pre-trained darkenet's (.weight) file

## Model files

These caffemodel files have been converted for you.

## Convert yolo's (.weight) files to caffemodel

If you want to create the caffemodel files from yolo's (.weights) files on your own, 

* first, you need to  download the pretrained yolo weight files in the darknet official website (http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 

* after that, run create_yolo_caffemodel.py to create the caffemodel from yolo's (.weight) files 

  	* "python create_yolo_caffemodel.py -m train_val_prototxt.filename -w yoloweights_filename -o caffemodel_filename"

  replace train_val_prototxt.filename with /your/path/to/yolo_train_val.prototxt (yolo_small, yolo_tiny),
  yoloweights_filename with /your/path/to/yolo.weights (yolo-small, yolo-tiny), and caffemodel_filename with your output caffemodel name,
  
  e.g.
  "python create_yolo_caffemodel.py -m yolo_train_val.prototxt -w yolo.weights -o yolo.caffemodel" 


## Main file usage

run yolo_main.py to do yolo object detection for the input image

* "python yolo_main.py -m model_filename -w weight_filename -i image_filename"

replace model_filename with /your/path/to/yolo_small_deploy.prototxt or yolo_tiny_deploy.prototxt, 
weight_filename with /your/path/to/yolo_tiny.caffemodel or yolo_small.caffemodel and image_filename with the target image file

you can use the cpp interface too

see yolo.cpp
